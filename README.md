# WindowsHelperProgram

WHP helps users open programs with ease

Tasks would include open any program in your computer with an input of "open Google", "open README.md", "store "filepath"", "close".



### ToDo's
- Create a storePath method that stores the path of program .exe's or .lnk's
- Create a closeWHP method that closes the program when user inputs "close".
- Create a friendly simple UI that only shows a textbox at the left lower corner of desktop.
- Create a method that gets the last argument of the file path of the .exe/.lnk and store it as the name of program.

These are the only ToDo's for now until we have completed the core of WindowsHelperProgram


### Ambitious Goals

- Create a Voice to Text method that makes the program even simplier activated by keyword
- Create a very simple AI that is capable of basic conversation with a focus on computer tasks (No Talk Back)
